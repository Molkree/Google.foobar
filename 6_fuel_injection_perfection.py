# Fuel Injection Perfection
# =========================

# Commander Lambda has asked for your help to refine the automatic quantum antimatter fuel injection system for the LAMBCHOP doomsday device. It's a great chance for you to get a closer look at the LAMBCHOP -- and maybe sneak in a bit of sabotage while you're at it -- so you took the job gladly.

# Quantum antimatter fuel comes in small pellets, which is convenient since the many moving parts of the LAMBCHOP each need to be fed fuel one pellet at a time. However, minions dump pellets in bulk into the fuel intake. You need to figure out the most efficient way to sort and shift the pellets down to a single pellet at a time.

# The fuel control mechanisms have three operations:

# 1) Add one fuel pellet
# 2) Remove one fuel pellet
# 3) Divide the entire group of fuel pellets by 2 (due to the destructive energy released when a quantum antimatter pellet is cut in half, the safety controls will only allow this to happen if there is an even number of pellets)

# Write a function called solution(n) which takes a positive integer as a string and returns the minimum number of operations needed to transform the number of pellets to 1. The fuel intake control panel can only display a number up to 309 digits long, so there won't ever be more pellets than you can express in that many digits.

# For example:
# solution(4) returns 2: 4 -> 2 -> 1
# solution(15) returns 5: 15 -> 16 -> 8 -> 4 -> 2 -> 1

def closest_power_of_2(n):
    floor_log = int(floor(log(n, 2)))
    ceil_log = int(ceil(log(n, 2)))
    floor_distance = abs(n - 2 ** floor_log)
    ceil_distance = abs(n - 2 ** ceil_log)
    return floor_log if floor_distance <= ceil_distance else ceil_log


def solution(n):
    pellets = int(n)
    closest_power = closest_power_of_2(pellets)
    return abs(pellets - 2 ** closest_power) + closest_power
